# CROP_PREDICTION
This project is a web-based application that predicts the optimal crop to plant based on various environmental and soil conditions using machine learning models.
The frontend provides a user-friendly interface, while the backend processes the data and runs the machine learning algorithms.
By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the model helps farmers and agriculturalists make data-driven decisions that maximize yield and minimize resource wastage.
